	<strong><em>Author: Kelceran Amberheel, Royal Archivist of Aevislan</em></strong>
	
	 This is a written record of the Arcyne Eyrie, the bastion of all magical talents in Llewyn.<br><br>

The Eyrie- located in the Roekan Province, has been the source of magickal talent across Llewyn since what we now call the Gilded Age. First founded by Xillynn, many an astute mind has graduated or associated themselves to such. Almost all those of such talents can trace themselves to the Eyrie.<br><br>

It began as a school of thought- a school to teach those in need. Over time it grew, and it grew. When Naexidor came, he demanded two things- the talents of the Eyrie, and their submission. Xillynn chose to do both, and the school was spared. Naexidor gave extreme amounts of lavish funding and it became the college of power that we know todae.<br><br>

Some of the most famous magickal figures in recent history are all graduates of the Eyrie- Vencyne the Red, Chaecyne Thuldia, and even its current Archmage: Laurence Dirarsk.<br><br>

To the esteemed reader: If you believe yourself capable of learning, or have felt such a spark of latent power in your very soul, seek the prospects of the Eyrie. You will be welcomed with open arms to Aevislan, her peoples, and the grand minds and talents of the Arcyne Eyrie.<br><br>"
