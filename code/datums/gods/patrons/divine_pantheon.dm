Dendor is a god that in recent years has gone silent, much believed to be due to the rapid growth and settlement of his lands, as well as the destruction of the environment. As a result, wildlife has become more fierce- wolves are rabid, and even local animals once benevolent seem to have their eyes filled with rage at those he holds responsible - mortals. Despite this, he has many preachers and worshippers, who believe it to be punishment from his divine roots, and that we must repent and seek repatriation by leaving our settlements and returning to the wilds. Many wood elves are practitioners of such beliefs, being found in the deepest woods."
